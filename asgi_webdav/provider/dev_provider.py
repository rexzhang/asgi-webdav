    9.1.1.  PROPFIND Status Codes

       This section, as with similar sections for other methods, provides
       some guidance on error codes and preconditions or postconditions
       (defined in Section 16) that might be particularly useful with
       PROPFIND.

       403 Forbidden - A server MAY reject PROPFIND requests on collections
       with depth header of "Infinity", in which case it SHOULD use this
       error with the precondition code 'propfind-finite-depth' inside the
       error body.

    9.1.2.  Status Codes for Use in 'propstat' Element

       In PROPFIND responses, information about individual properties_list is
       returned inside 'propstat' elements (see Section 14.22), each
       containing an individual 'status' element containing information
       about the properties_list appearing in it. The list below summarizes the
       most common status codes used inside 'propstat'; however, clients
       should be prepared to handle other 2/3/4/5xx series status codes as
       well.

       200 OK - A property exists and/or its value is successfully returned.

       401 Unauthorized - The property cannot be viewed without appropriate
       authorization.

       403 Forbidden - The property cannot be viewed regardless of
       authentication.

       404 Not Found - The property does not exist.

    https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4918#section-11
    11.  Status Code Extensions to HTTP/1.1

       The following status codes are added to those defined in HTTP/1.1
       [RFC2616].

    11.1.  207 Multi-Status

       The 207 (Multi-Status) status code provides status for multiple
       independent operations (see Section 13 for more information).

    11.2.  422 Unprocessable Entity

       The 422 (Unprocessable Entity) status code means the server
       understands the content type of the request entity (hence a
       415(Unsupported Media Type) status code is inappropriate), and the
       syntax of the request entity is correct (thus a 400 (Bad Request)
       status code is inappropriate) but was unable to process the contained
       instructions.  For example, this error condition may occur if an XML
       request body contains well-formed (i.e., syntactically correct), but
       semantically erroneous, XML instructions.

    11.3.  423 Locked

       The 423 (Locked) status code means the source or destination resource
       of a method is locked.  This response SHOULD contain an appropriate
       precondition or postcondition code, such as 'lock-token-submitted' or
       'no-conflicting-lock'.

    11.4.  424 Failed Dependency

       The 424 (Failed Dependency) status code means that the method could
       not be performed on the resource because the requested action
       depended on another action and that action failed.  For example, if a
       command in a PROPPATCH method fails, then, at minimum, the rest of
       the commands will also fail with 424 (Failed Dependency).

    11.5.  507 Insufficient Storage

       The 507 (Insufficient Storage) status code means the method could not
       be performed on the resource because the server is unable to store
       the representation needed to successfully complete the request.  This
       condition is considered to be temporary.  If the request that
       received this status code was the result of a user action, the
       request MUST NOT be repeated until it is requested by a separate user
       action.

    9.4.  GET, HEAD for Collections

       The semantics of GET are unchanged when applied to a collection,
       since GET is defined as, "retrieve whatever information (in the form
       of an entity) is identified by the Request-URI" [RFC2616].  GET, when
       applied to a collection, may return the contents of an "index.html"
       resource, a human-readable view of the contents of the collection, or
       something else altogether.  Hence, it is possible that the result of
       a GET on a collection will bear no correlation to the membership of
       the collection.

       Similarly, since the definition of HEAD is a GET without a response
       message body, the semantics of HEAD are unmodified when applied to
       collection resources.

    https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#page-53
    9.3 GET

       The GET method means retrieve whatever information (in the form of an
       entity) is identified by the Request-URI. If the Request-URI refers
       to a data-producing process, it is the produced data which shall be
       returned as the entity in the response and not the source text of the
       process, unless that text happens to be the output of the process.

       The semantics of the GET method change to a "conditional GET" if the
       request message includes an If-Modified-Since, If-Unmodified-Since,
       If-Match, If-None-Match, or If-Range header field. A conditional GET
       method requests that the entity be transferred only under the
       circumstances described by the conditional header field(s). The
       conditional GET method is intended to reduce unnecessary network
       usage by allowing cached entities to be refreshed without requiring
       multiple requests or transferring data already held by the client.

       The semantics of the GET method change to a "partial GET" if the
       request message includes a Range header field. A partial GET requests
       that only part of the entity be transferred, as described in section
       14.35. The partial GET method is intended to reduce unnecessary
       network usage by allowing partially-retrieved entities to be
       completed without transferring data already held by the client.

       The response to a GET request is cacheable if and only if it meets
       the requirements for HTTP caching described in section 13.

       See section 15.1.3 for security considerations when used for forms.

    https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7233#section-4.2
    4.2.  Content-Range

       The "Content-Range" header field is sent in a single part 206
       (Partial Content) response to indicate the partial range of the
       selected representation enclosed as the message payload, sent in each
       part of a multipart 206 response to indicate the range enclosed
       within each body part, and sent in 416 (Range Not Satisfiable)
       responses to provide information about the selected representation.

    9.6.  DELETE Requirements

       DELETE is defined in [RFC2616], Section 9.7, to "delete the resource
       identified by the Request-URI".  However, WebDAV changes some DELETE
       handling requirements.

       A server processing a successful DELETE request:

          MUST destroy locks rooted on the deleted resource

          MUST remove the mapping from the Request-URI to any resource.

       Thus, after a successful DELETE operation (and in the absence of
       other actions), a subsequent GET/HEAD/PROPFIND request to the target
       Request-URI MUST return 404 (Not Found).

    9.6.1.  DELETE for Collections

       The DELETE method on a collection MUST act as if a "Depth: infinity"
       header was used on it.  A client MUST NOT submit a Depth header with
       a DELETE on a collection with any value but infinity.

       DELETE instructs that the collection specified in the Request-URI and
       all resources identified by its internal member URLs are to be
       deleted.

       If any resource identified by a member URL cannot be deleted, then
       all of the member's ancestors MUST NOT be deleted, so as to maintain
       URL namespace consistency.

       Any headers included with DELETE MUST be applied in processing every
       resource to be deleted.

       When the DELETE method has completed processing, it MUST result in a
       consistent URL namespace.

       If an error occurs deleting a member resource (a resource other than
       the resource identified in the Request-URI), then the response can be
       a 207 (Multi-Status).  Multi-Status is used here to indicate which
       internal resources could NOT be deleted, including an error code,
       which should help the client understand which resources caused the
       failure.  For example, the Multi-Status body could include a response
       with status 423 (Locked) if an internal resource was locked.

       The server MAY return a 4xx status response, rather than a 207, if
       the request failed completely.

       424 (Failed Dependency) status codes SHOULD NOT be in the 207 (Multi-
       Status) response for DELETE.  They can be safely left out because the
       client will know that the ancestors of a resource could not be
       deleted when the client receives an error for the ancestor's progeny.
       Additionally, 204 (No Content) errors SHOULD NOT be returned in the
       207 (Multi-Status).  The reason for this prohibition is that 204 (No
       Content) is the default success code.

    https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-9.7
    9.7 DELETE

       The DELETE method requests that the origin server delete the resource
       identified by the Request-URI. This method MAY be overridden by human
       intervention (or other means) on the origin server. The client cannot
       be guaranteed that the operation has been carried out, even if the
       status code returned from the origin server indicates that the action
       has been completed successfully. However, the server SHOULD NOT
       indicate success unless, at the time the response is given, it
       intends to delete the resource or move it to an inaccessible
       location.

       A successful response SHOULD be 200 (OK) if the response includes an
       entity describing the status, 202 (Accepted) if the action has not
       yet been enacted, or 204 (No Content) if the action has been enacted
       but the response does not include an entity.

       If the request passes through a cache and the Request-URI identifies
       one or more currently cached entities, those entries SHOULD be
       treated as stale. Responses to this method are not cacheable.

    9.7.  PUT Requirements

    9.7.1.  PUT for Non-Collection Resources

       A PUT performed on an existing resource replaces the GET response
       entity of the resource.  Properties defined on the resource may be
       recomputed during PUT processing but are not otherwise affected.  For
       example, if a server recognizes the content type of the request body,
       it may be able to automatically extract information that could be
       profitably exposed as properties_list.

       A PUT that would result in the creation of a resource without an
       appropriately scoped parent collection MUST fail with a 409
       (Conflict).

       A PUT request allows a client to indicate what media type an entity
       body has, and whether it should change if overwritten.  Thus, a
       client SHOULD provide a Content-Type for a new resource if any is
       known.  If the client does not provide a Content-Type for a new
       resource, the server MAY create a resource with no Content-Type
       assigned, or it MAY attempt to assign a Content-Type.

       Note that although a recipient ought generally to treat metadata
       supplied with an HTTP request as authoritative, in practice there's
       no guarantee that a server will accept client-supplied metadata
       (e.g., any request header beginning with "Content-").  Many servers
       do not allow configuring the Content-Type on a per-resource basis in
       the first place.  Thus, clients can't always rely on the ability to
       directly influence the content type by including a Content-Type
       request header.

    9.7.2.  PUT for Collections

       This specification does not define the behavior of the PUT method for
       existing collections.  A PUT request to an existing collection MAY be
       treated as an error (405 Method Not Allowed).

       The MKCOL method is defined to create collections.

       204 (No Content) - The source resource was successfully copied to a
       preexisting destination resource.

       207 (Multi-Status) - Multiple resources were to be affected by the
       COPY, but errors on some of them prevented the operation from taking
       place.  Specific error messages, together with the most appropriate
       of the source and destination URLs, appear in the body of the multi-
       status response.  For example, if a destination resource was locked
       and could not be overwritten, then the destination resource URL
       appears with the 423 (Locked) status.

       403 (Forbidden) - The operation is forbidden.  A special case for
       COPY could be that the source and destination resources are the same
       resource.

       409 (Conflict) - A resource cannot be created at the destination
       until one or more intermediate collections have been created.  The
       server MUST NOT create those intermediate collections automatically.

       412 (Precondition Failed) - A precondition header check failed, e.g.,
       the Overwrite header is "F" and the destination URL is already mapped
       to a resource.

       423 (Locked) - The destination resource, or resource within the
       destination collection, was locked.  This response SHOULD contain the
       'lock-token-submitted' precondition element.

       502 (Bad Gateway) - This may occur when the destination is on another
       server, repository, or URL namespace.  Either the source namespace
       does not support copying to the destination namespace, or the
       destination namespace refuses to accept the resource.  The client may
       wish to try GET/PUT and PROPFIND/PROPPATCH instead.

       201 (Created) - The source resource was successfully moved, and a new

       of the source and destination URLs, appear in the body of the multi-

       could not be moved, then the source resource URL appears with the 423
       (Locked) status.

       403 (Forbidden) - Among many possible reasons for forbidding a MOVE
       operation, this status code is recommended for use when the source
       and destination resources are the same.

       until one or more intermediate collections have been created.  The
       server MUST NOT create those intermediate collections automatically.

       properties_list and still move the resource to the destination (see
       'preserved-live-properties_list' postcondition).

       412 (Precondition Failed) - A condition header failed.  Specific to
       MOVE, this could mean that the Overwrite header is "F" and the
       destination URL is already mapped to a resource.

       423 (Locked) - The source or the destination resource, the source or
       destination resource parent, or some resource within the source or
